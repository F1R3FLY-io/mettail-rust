# Papers

## Already written

- Native Types

- Hypercube paper

## Yet to write

- GSLTs for operational semantics.  Hennessey–Milner Thm.
  - structure-preserving functors between them ("syntactic category of GSLTs")
  - strong-bisimulation-preserving maps between them ("semantic cat of GSLTs").  "Map" here is a map of LTSs between the LTSs generated from the GSLTs where labels come from reduction contexts.
    - Main theorem: processes are bisimilar iff they satisfy the same formulae
    - What are the relevant formulae to make that true?
      - Topos: T, F, and, or, not, modal operators from hypercube
  - MeTTaIL's role

- Compare Hypercube (with structural stuff but may have weaker logic) to paper above (without structural stuff but with topos).
  - Functor that extends syntax of a theory so we can talk about term constructors in the original as behavior in extension and thus capture structural types as well for the purposes of bisimilarity

- Stochastic stuff
  - define finite presentations of weighted GSLTs
